First and foremost, I would like to thank my family: my wife, Jihwa and my two sons, Woojoo and Suho for their support and encouragement throughout my graduate study. 

I give a special thank to my advisor Dr. Randy Beard for being a great and patient advisor. He has guided me to be more capable researcher, engineer, thinker, and learner. Especially, I would like to acknowledge that he has introduced the non-linear approaches for the gimbal and UAV control. I also acknowledge the other members of my graduate committee members: Dr. Timothy McLain and Dr. D.J. Lee for teaching closely related courses for my research.

I also would like to acknowledge Jerel Nielsen, Jeff Millard, Parker Lusk, Josh Sakamaki, and Mark Petersen for the engagement as a research group. The discussions I had with them has helped me greatly to make progress on my research. 

Lastly, I thank all the members of the BYU MAGICC lab to create a wonderful learning opportunity and fun place to work and study.
