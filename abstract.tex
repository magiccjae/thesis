The Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is an emerging technology in a variety of application such as surveillance, search and rescue, package delivery and target tracking. In particular, target tracking can make a good use of a UAS platform with an on-board camera because the platform can adjust its altitude in order to get the desired camera field of view (FOV) and image quality of the target. This thesis presents some existing gimbal and UAV control algorithms as well as novel algorithms developed as the extensions of the existing ones.
